Basically the corresponding equation of the PD is converted into R code. For example, the Gaussian distribution Probability Density Function (PDF) is represented in @eq-gaussian-pdf.\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\, e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n$${#eq-gaussian-pdf}\n\n## Gaussian distribution example\n\nLet's convert the @eq-gaussian-pdf into R code. Our variable is $x$ then we have $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ that are the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n#| collapse: true\nnorm <- function(x, mean = 0, sd = 1){\n    1 / sqrt(2 * pi * sd^2) * exp(-((x - mean)^2)/(2 * sd^2))\n}\n\nnorm(0)\nnorm(2)\nnorm(-1)\n```\n\n## Gaussian distribution example\n\nWith the previous code we are calculating the probability density of a certain value given the parameters. Let's use `norm()` for a sequence of values and plot the results.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 5\nx <- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)\ny <- norm(x)\n\n# TODO increase labels size\nplot(x, y, type = \"l\", ylab = \"Density\", main = \"norm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)\")\n```\n\n## Gaussian distribution example\n\nClearly, if we change the parameters, the calculated densities will be different. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 5\nx <- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)\ny1 <- norm(x)\ny2 <- norm(x, 1, 1)\n\n# TODO increase labels size\nplot(x, y2, type = \"l\", ylab = \"Density\", col = \"dodgerblue\", lwd = 2)\nlines(x, y1, col = \"firebrick\", lwd = 2)\nabline(v = 0, lty = \"dashed\", lwd = 1.5)\npoints(x = c(0, 0), y = c(norm(0), norm(0, 1)), pch = 19, col = c(\"firebrick\", \"dodgerblue\"), cex = 2)\n```\n\n## Gaussian distribution in R\n\nFortunately we do not need to write the probabilities distribution manually but a lot of them are already included in R.
