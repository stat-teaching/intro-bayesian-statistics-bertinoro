We can use as an example the Study conducted by the University of Padua (TEDDY Child
Study, 2020)^[Thanks to Prof. Paolo Girardi for the example, see https://teddychild.dpss.psy.unipd.it/ for information]. Within the study, researchers asked the participants (mothers of a young child) about the presence of post-partum depression and measured the parental stress using the PSI-Parenting Stress Index.

```{r}
teddy <- read.csv(here("data/clean/teddy_child.csv"))
head(teddy)
```

Exploring the dataset try to fit Bayesian models predicting the `Parental_stress` with a set of predictors using additive effects and interactions.
