title: "PhD Stress Level Dataset and Exercises"
---

# Dataset Description

This dataset contains information on PhD students' stress levels (scale 0 to 100) along with several predictors:

- **Coffee:** Number of coffee cups consumed per day (integer)  
- **Spritz:** Number of spritz (aperitif) consumed per week (integer)  
- **Statistical Knowledge:** Self-assessed score from 0 to 10  
- **Software Used:** Statistical software used (`R`, `SPSS`, `Excel`)

You can download the dataset [here](../data/clean/phd.csv)

# Exercises

These exercises will help you explore the dataset, understand relationships, and fit a linear regression model.

### 1. Load and Explore the Data

- Load the dataset.  
- Fix problems in the dataset, impute missing numerical values with the mean and missing categorical variables with a random value from the available values.
- Calculate means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges for all numeric variables.  
- Examine the distribution of the categorical variable `software_used` with counts and proportions.

### 2. Visualize the Data

- Plot histograms or density plots for the numeric variables (stress, coffee, spritz, statistical knowledge).  
- Create boxplots of stress by `software_used`.  
- Create scatterplots:
  - Stress vs Coffee  
  - Stress vs Spritz (color points by `software_used`)  
  - Stress vs Statistical Knowledge  

### 3. Check Relationships and Correlations

- Compute correlation coefficients between numeric variables.  
- Comment on the strength and direction of relationships between stress and each predictor.

### 4. Fit a Linear Regression Model

- Fit a linear regression model predicting stress from coffee, spritz, statistical knowledge, `software_used`, and the interaction between spritz and software
- Examine the model summary and interpret the coefficients, especially the interaction terms
